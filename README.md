This is a script for Proshine https://github.com/Silv3rPRO/proshine

This Script will do the subway quest for you, it requires that you have 50k gold, a Bicycle and a Pokemon with the move `Covet` or `Thief` that can at least kill a low level Pidgeotto, aswell as having finished the Kanto Regions.
Also keep in mind the third step is only doable at night time.

If you don't have a Thief or Covet pokemon you can run the Thief Quest file which will get you a Thief TM for 7500 gold.
